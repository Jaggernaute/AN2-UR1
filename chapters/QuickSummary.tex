\textbf{Comparison of Functions \Cref{functions:comp/ord:comp}} : Learn to compare growth rates of functions (e.g., exponential vs. polynomial). Understand which functions dominate others as their variables grow large.
%% TODO: maybe use \nameref{}, and more fluid description of chapters

\textbf{Orders of Magnitude \Cref{functions:comp/ord:ord}} : Analyze how a function behaves asymptotically (e.g., \(f(x)=x^2\) is smaller than \(g(x)=e^x\) for large $x$).
%% NOTE: `\makebox` is used to fix the width of "In Chapter X" part

\textbf{Applications \Cref{functions:comp/ord:app}} : Use these concepts to simplify problems by focusing on dominant terms in a function.

\begin{Note}[WIP Disclaimer]
    Both \Cref{ch:Features} and \Cref{ch:Tips} are as of now Work-in-Progress.
    There is a lot of stuff yet to be exhibited and explained.
    All the colored \textsf{TODO}-like environments are to be resolved in the final version of this document.
\end{Note}
