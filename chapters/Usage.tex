\chapter{Usage of \TeXtured{}} \label{ch:Usage}

To quickly familiarize yourself with the \TeXtured{} template, we will go through the basic structure of the template files and explain how to use them.
First, have a look at \Cref{fig:file-structure} for a visual representation of the file structure.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \fcapside[\FBwidth]{%
        \captionsetup{parskip = .5\baselineskip plus 1pt}%
        \caption[\TeXtured{} Template File Structure]{%
            \TeXtured{} template file structure.

            The main file is \path{thesis.tex}.
            It does not contain the actual content of the document, but instead \fakemacro{\include}s the chapters and \emph{front matter} pages from the corresponding directories.

            Make sure to fill all PDF \grayenclose{meta}data --- like title, author, etc.~--- in the \path{preamble/data.tex} file.
            The bibliography/reference data is stored in the \path{preamble/bibliography.bib} file.

            All of the \TeXtured{} tweaks and settings located in files under \path{preamble/...} directories are loaded by the \path{preamble/main.tex} file, which is itself \fakemacro{\input}ed in the \path{thesis.tex} file.

            The \path{.latexmkrc} file contains a configuration for the \textsf{latexmk} tool, which provides a convenient way to compile the document.

\begin{remark}[License]
    If you want to make your document publicly available (together with the source code), you should not forget to include an appropriate license of your choice --- change the \path{LICENSE} file, specifying the \href{https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}{\texttt{CC0 1.0 Universal}} license of \TeXtured{}.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}[MFF CUNI Template Compatibility]
    \TeXtured{} can be used out of the box for theses at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague.
    Just be sure to include all \emph{front matter} pages and fill out necessary data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textsf{Title Page} with the faculty logo (among other things),
        \item \textsf{Declaration},
        \item \textsf{Dedication} (optional),
        \item \textsf{Information Page} including the \textsf{Abstract}.
    \end{itemize}
    This is done by uncommenting the relevant lines in the main file \path{thesis.tex}.

    Layout of these front matter pages is adapted and modified from the original MFF CUNI template \autocite{MaresTemplate}.
    However, always make sure it is compliant with the faculty guidelines, otherwise please raise an issue on \textsf{GitHub} \autocite{TeXtured}.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Customizability Toggles]
    There are a couple of toggles in the \path{thesis.tex} file that can be used to customize style/layout/creation of the document.
\end{remark}
