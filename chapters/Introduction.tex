Mathematics forms the backbone of many scientific and engineering disciplines, providing the tools and methods necessary to solve complex problems and model real-world phenomena. This document serves as a comprehensive compilation of notes and concepts for two fundamental courses taken during the third semester of the L2 ISTN program: \emph{Analysis 2 (AN2)} and \emph{Mathematical Tools (OM)}. These courses are designed to build on the foundational mathematics covered in the first year, equipping students with advanced analytical and problem-solving skills that are critical for their academic and professional journeys.

The course *Analysis 2 (AN2)* focuses on developing a deeper understanding of functions, integrals, and series. It emphasizes the practical application of advanced calculus methods while fostering a rigorous and precise approach to mathematical reasoning. Topics such as function behavior \Cref{functions} , Taylor expansions for limit calculations \Cref{functions:taylor}, generalized integrals \Cref{int}, numerical series \Cref{nseries}, and power series \Cref{pseries}, are introduced, laying the groundwork for subsequent studies in probability, quantitative analysis, and other advanced courses in the curriculum. The structured and methodical approach to problem-solving emphasized in this course ensures that students not only grasp theoretical concepts but also apply them effectively.

The second course, *Mathematical Tools (OM)*, provides the mathematical techniques necessary for a wide range of applications in physics, engineering, and beyond. By exploring topics such as the solution of differential equations, transformations between coordinate systems, and Fourier series, this course equips students with versatile tools to analyze and model dynamic systems. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling students to approach complex problems with confidence.
