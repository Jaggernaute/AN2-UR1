## 🚀 Elevator Pitch

Do you care in the slightest about what your readers think about your document,
and by proxy about you and your competence level? If yes, then a classy,
typographically professional layout and structured, clear, and revealing content
can only help. This template tries to aid you in both of these endeavors.

To learn more about the design principles behind `TeXtured` and its capabilities, look
at the [TeXtured Demo](https://jdujava.github.io/TeXtured/thesis.pdf). It showcases the
features of `TeXtured` template and provides a guide on how to use them (still WIP 🚧).

> [!TIP]
> If you find something interesting or useful, but adopting the whole template
> is simply too much, feel free to just copy and use relevant parts of the code.
> (🚧 TODO: link relevant files for corresponding features in DEMO file)

## 🏗️ Building

Be sure to have all the dependencies installed (at least the LaTeX build tools), and run
```sh
latexmk thesis
```
in the root directory of the repository to build the thesis.

## 📦 Software Dependencies

LaTeX build tools:
- `latexmk` - LaTeX build tool
- `pdflatex`/`lualatex` - LaTeX engine (you can choose one in `.latexmkrc`)
- `biber` - bibliography processing tool for `biblatex`

> [!WARNING]
> At this point it is unclear what is the minimal required LaTeX installation.
> Full `TeX Live` distribution is surely enough, since it is used in GitHub Actions
> to automatically build the latest version of the [TeXtured Demo](https://jdujava.github.io/TeXtured/thesis.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> Some scripts assume `linux` environment. These include:
> - generation of directory structure for `aux_dir` (dependencies are `sed`, `xargs`)
> - vector figure generation (together with watermark)
>     + need to enable `--shell-escape` in `.latexmkrc`
>     + `inkscape` - vector graphics (and SVG to PDF conversion)
>     + `perl` - disabling `/Interpolation` in PDFs generated by `inkscape`
>     + `sed` - substituting placeholders in PDF watermark
>     + `ghostscript` - injecting `postscript` watermark into PDF

<!-- TODO: maybe describe what to disable if running on Windows -->
<!-- TODO: maybe utilize [details](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-collapsed-sections) -->

Version control:
- `git` - (obviously) the preferred version control system
- `git-lfs` - [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) - for storing PDFs, figures, etc.

<!-- TODO: maybe describe what to disable if someone doesn't want to use `git-lfs` -->
